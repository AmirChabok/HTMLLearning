		If you want to play with it - here it is: in my Github repo. It's a single file - something you can use, change, love, explore, beat up, cuddle, and generally ignore if you feel like it. It's simple data access - just about as simple as it gets. I needed to give it a name (because if I didn't someone else would and I'm afraid of what that would be) - so I decided to call it "Massive".It started out at 350 lines of code, and then I refactored out WebMatrix.Data and pushed it well over 500 until Dave Cowart came along and squeezed it down to a readable 400 lines. Love that! Go Open Source! I toyed around with calling it "SubSonic 4.0" - because honestly everything I ever tried to do with SubSonic is in here. But I thought the better of it - there are a number of really great people keeping SubSonic up and running, and I don't want to be a sh** and pull the rug out.
